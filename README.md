# gmx_qk
gmx_qk is an automated bash workflow that enables users to execute simulations of **protein in water/protein-ligand complexes** with only a basic understanding of **UNIX or command-line tools**.
After receiving the input files and parameters, it starts the MD simulations in a matter of seconds, whereas a command-line-basedÂ protocol would take **20 to 30 minutes**.
Through the use of **g_mmpbsa**, it acts as a bridge between the **MD engine** and **MM/PBSA-based binding free energy calculations** (gromacs version 2021.4)
Simplicity and lack of expertise in complicated tool installation or compilation processes, such as Gromacs command line-based utilities.
Users are assisted in producing reproducible research outcomes by a single workflow.
  
As its under consideration for publication, so it is now available in public doamain with GPL 3.0 Licence. (It can be used free of cost, modified and distributed with no warranty).
