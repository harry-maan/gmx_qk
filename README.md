# gmx_qk
gmx_qk is an automated bash workflow that enables users to execute simulations of **protein in water/protein-ligand complexes** with only a basic understanding of **UNIX or command-line tools**.
After receiving the input files and parameters, it starts the MD simulations in a matter of seconds, whereas a command-line-basedÂ protocol would take **20 to 30 minutes**.
Through the use of **g_mmpbsa**, it acts as a bridge between the **MD engine** and **MM/PBSA-based binding free energy calculations** (gromacs version 2021.4)
Simplicity and lack of expertise in complicated tool installation or compilation processes, such as Gromacs command line-based utilities.
Users are assisted in producing reproducible research outcomes by a single workflow.
  
As its code under development phase, no publication has been made, so it is not available in public doamain. (comming soon after any publication record).


**NOTE: Make sure that internet connection is working during installation to download its all dependencies from different repositories i.e., Python modules, and build-essentials**
